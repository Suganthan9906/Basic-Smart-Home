## Requirements
- **Hardware**:
  - ESP32 microcontroller
  - USB cable for programming
- **Software**:
  - Arduino IDE (with the ESP32 board support installed)
  - Blynk Library (can be installed via the Arduino IDE Library Manager)

## Getting Started

### Installation
1. Install the Arduino IDE if not already installed. [Download Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)
2. Add ESP32 board support in the Arduino IDE. Follow the [ESP32 setup guide](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/installing-the-esp32-board-in-arduino-ide-windows-instructions/).
3. Install the Blynk library:
   - Open the Arduino IDE.
   - Go to `Sketch` > `Include Library` > `Manage Libraries`.
   - Search for "Blynk" and install the library.

### Configuration
1. Replace the placeholder in the code with your **Blynk Auth Token**:
   ```cpp
   char auth[] = "Your_Blynk_Auth_Token";
